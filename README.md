# Aurelia + TypeScript + Webpack Starter Kit

A minimal [Aurelia][aurelia] starter kit written in [TypeScript][typescript] and
built using [webpack][webpack].

## Building

The project can be built by running `npm run dev` which will assemble the
distribution under the `./dist` directory. This directory can be cleaned by
running `npm run clean`.

## Developing

The [webpack-dev-server][dev-server] is installed for development purposes and
can be run with the command `npm start`. This will start the development
server at [`http://localhost:8080`][localhost] and open it in your browser, with
[inline mode][inline] and [hot module replacement][hmr] enabled.

When debugging you can enable Protractor's
[interactive mode][protractor-interactive] by running `npm run e2e:debug`.
